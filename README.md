Identifying the vulnerability path and vulnerability parameter is necessary for determining the root cause of the vulnerability and developing appropriate mitigation strategies.
Finally, the report should provide detailed instructions on how to reproduce each vulnerability. This information is crucial for developers to understand the specific steps required to fix the vulnerability.
To ensure that the report is comprehensive and detailed, it should be between 30 to 50 pages. By providing detailed information and analysis, the report will enable developers and stakeholders to understand the potential impact of the vulnerabilities and take appropriate action to address them.
